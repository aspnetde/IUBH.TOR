\subsection{Structure}

This thesis will first introduce mobile app development with Xamarin and show how apps are typically built today within the Xamarin ecosystem. It will then introduce functional programming in general, examine the paradigm's current state of adoption in the industry, and then take a look at FP in .NET, with emphasis on F\# and a short excursion to C\#.  The next step is to show how functional programming could be implemented in the context of Xamarin. Three different ways are identified, which all allow to leverage FP to a different degree. Based on these theoretical fundamentals, a case study can now be carried out. The requirements and research methodology are discussed, and finally, the results are presented and evaluated.
