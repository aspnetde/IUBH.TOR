Little research has been done so far with regards to the application of functional programming in the mobile application space. There do exist plenty of papers on both functional programming and mobile app development, but with almost no intersection.

The most remarkable paper in this regard has been published by \cite{petersen_experience_2013}, who have shown how to develop a cross-platform framework for embedded and mobile applications written in Scheme for the medical field. 

\cite{kiss_comparison_2014} compared functional and object-oriented programming approaches for the development of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in an exhaustive study, using Java and Scala primarily. 

\cite{czaplicki_elm:_2012} introduced a new functional programming language called Elm. Elm is based on the ideas of Functional Reactive Programming and provided important preliminary work for derived concepts used to build web and mobile applications in various programming environments.
