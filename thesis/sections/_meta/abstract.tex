In recent years, functional programming has emerged from the academic world and has steadily gained popularity in the software industry. Still, it has not yet fully arrived in all application fields where it could bring its advantages to bear. This thesis examines the suitability of functional programming for the development of mobile applications using F\# and Xamarin and compares it to the established method of object-oriented programming with C\#. It therefore first shows how apps are typically built today within the Xamarin ecosystem. It then introduces functional programming in general and F\# in particular, and it examines how app development with Xamarin could benefit from it. A case study is then carried out in which an app for Android and iOS is implemented twice: once object-oriented with C\#, once functional with F\#. The evaluation of this case study shows that functional programming with F\# can be a viable alternative to the established object-oriented approach with C\#.

Keywords: \textit{Functional Programming, OOP, F\#, C\#, Xamarin, iOS, Android}
