\subsection{Ecosystem and tooling}

Xamarin apps can be developed on Windows, macOS, and Linux, using IDEs such as Visual Studio, Visual Studio for Mac, or JetBrains Rider. In order to build applications for the Apple platform, tools are required, which are only available on macOS.

Both open-source developers and commercial vendors supply a vibrant ecosystem of third-party libraries aside from the official Xamarin products. Libraries that do not exist on the Xamarin platform itself can be integrated into Xamarin apps through so-called bindings. This is supported for iOS\footnote{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/platform/binding-objective-c/ (retrieved August 8, 2019)} and Android\footnote{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/android/platform/native-libraries (retrieved August 8, 2019)} as well.
