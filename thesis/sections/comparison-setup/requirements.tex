\subsection{Functional requirements}

In order to build an application that covers all of the technical features listed in the previous section, a practical case related to the IUBH has been chosen.

Students enrolled to distance learning courses at IUBH have access to a website within the university's "CARE portal" that allows them to get an overview of the current state of booked modules and the grades they received â€“ their transcript of records. However, at the time of writing, there is no notification system in place that would let them know about a new grade or any other change to their transcript of records, which leads for thousands of students to the tedious task of continuously logging in to the portal and navigating to that website, often multiple times a day. 

The sample app built for this thesis, IUBH TOR, is addressing this problem. Its detailed specification, including visual mockups of its user interface, can be found in Appendix A.
