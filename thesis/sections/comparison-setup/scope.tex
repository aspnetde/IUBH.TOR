\subsection{Scope and complexity}

While Xamarin offers a variety of different paths to implement mobile apps, comparing all of them would go way beyond the scope of this thesis. Therefore Xamarin.Forms is chosen. It is not only prevalent amongst Xamarin developers, but it is also the foundation of the Fabulous library.

A case study will be conducted by building a small sample application, IUBH TOR. That app will be implemented twice: in C\# with an object-oriented MVVM architecture, and in F\# with a functional MVU architecture. Both implementations will address the same problem to provide feature-parity results in terms of the functional requirements introduced later on. 

It is not possible to cover every conceivable technical scenario. Instead, the focus is on several features that are at the core of most modern mobile applications: managing a persistent user session; exchanging data with a backend; transforming data and persisting it permanently (e.g., in a local database); displaying data in a list; displaying data on a detail dialog; navigation between dialogs; periodic, scheduled, background work; delivering messages to the user through the platform's notification system. Design (UI) and usability (UX) are not in focus during the case study.
